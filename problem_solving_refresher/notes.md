Data structures - a set of data organized on the basis of logical and mathematical laws.

In general, abstract data types(ADT) gives us a definition(abstraction) of the specific structure, i.e. defines the allowed operations and properties without being interested in the specific implementation. This allows an abstract data type to have several different implementations and respectively different efficiency.

We can differentiate several groups of daata structures:
- **Linear** - these include lists, stacks and queues
- **Tree-like** - different types of trees like binary trees, B-trees, and balanced trees
- **Dictionaries** - Key-value pairs organized in hash tables
- **Sets** - Unordered bunches of unique elements
