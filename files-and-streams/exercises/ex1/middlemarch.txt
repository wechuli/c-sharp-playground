We mortals, men and women, devour many a 
disappointment between breakfast and dinner-time;
keep back the tears and look a little pale about the lips,
and in answer to inquiries say,
"Oh, nothing!" Pride helps;
and pride is not a bad thing when it only urges us to hide our hurts
— not to hurt others.
